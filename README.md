# NathansPortfolioProject

## Description

- This project was created to provide a building block for my portfolio that will be build upon throughout the course.
- This project was built to start a format that will be used to spread information about me, the work I have done, and ways to contact me.
- The project focused on HTML and CSS codes that are clean and consolidated, using media queries to enhace user experience, and CSS flex properties to provide a healthy experience for different interfaces.
- Through the project I learned the importance of different types of media resolutions and how they relate to CSS semantics.  I learned how organize my html and CSS codes to better suit these different kinds of resoultions to enhance the viewing and user interface experience. I also improved my understanding of Github and CSS coding for appearance and sustainability throughout a project.
